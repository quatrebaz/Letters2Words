# Letters2Words
An endless zen game of dictionary spree.

- Welcome to Letters2Words -

  Rationale: Games can be a bit competitive and nerve-wracking, yes, such can yield multitudes of benefits,
  but, our team ought to produce something that is relaxing and, at the same time, intellectually stimulating.

  Here comes a Scrabble-inspired spin on an endless game!

  Maximize points (the longer the word, the larger the score)
  Reach YOUR highest level, and improve your grasp on the English Language.

Using Python integrations such as the DICTIONARY, the randomization,
as well as the usage of the PyGames Interface
it infuses a seamless game of unlimited fun. 


Mechanics:
- TYPE the words, or CLICK the letter tiles to create a word;
- IF the word is valid, the word TURNS GREEN;
- Once a threshold score is reached, the game levels up!
- A maximum amount of letters (11) and a minimum is set (7);
- To ensure QoL, the code reads if the given generated letters form at least (15) words for it to display;
- The vowels, as well as the consonants are RANDOMIZED in such a way that they can only appear a MAX of (2);
- Less likely consonants are coded to appear less frequently in accordance to their frequency in English.

Objectives:
- As this is an endless game, the goal of the player is to reach the relaxed zen mode infused by the relaxing music and effects.
